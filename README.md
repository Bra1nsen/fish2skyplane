Image Transformation Sky Hemisphere 

The following remaps a fisheye image such that distances on a plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the fisheye lens, are proportional to the distances on the image. Typically used for an upwards pointing fisheye lens where one want to measure the speed or area of features (such as clouds) at some height above the ground.
